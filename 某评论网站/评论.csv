Forget American Carriers,5,"We've flown across the Pacific and Atlantic many times, and this trip with Cathay reinforced our experience that non-USA carriers are much better.

Food was better than the typical slop of American carriers, and the back-of-seat...",International' 'Economy' 'San Francisco - Bangkok

Very good premium coach,4,"In my experience, this premium economy option was well worth the extra money.

Premium Economy OK,3,"This airline’s Premium Economy is OK but well short of our experience with Air New Zealand.
